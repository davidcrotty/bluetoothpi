# Purpose
This project is a proof of concept for enabling BlueTooth LE communication between two devices. One being able to act as the client and the other the GATT Server.

## Scope
This is a POC to check the workings of the Bluetooth LE spec in conjunction with the Android Bluetooth LE API's.

## Branches
* master - Releasable progress.
* develop - Work in progress.
* experimental/* - Understanding or experimenting with a possible concept.

## TODO's
* Implement GATT Server on a Raspberry Pi 3 to see if error 29 still occurs and is indeed an error with the Bluetooth hardware stack/native implementation on the nexus 6P.
* Create Android things application for reading a temperature sensor on a Raspberry pi 3.
